something i put together cos i was bored idk how it may help, because it's written in js its kinda slow, but it can like run with ~100 circles at like 20 frames on my shitty macbook.

for those who just wanna check out what it is, you just gotta open the .html file in your browser (usually double clicking the file opens it)
